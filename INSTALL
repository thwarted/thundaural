Just a short overview of the installation to get you started.  I am, of 
course, available to help you with installation.  You can contact me at
    ta at thwartedefforts dot org
or on AIM, my AIM logon is ThwartedE

More dependancies are listed on the website.

Review server/Settings.pm.  Hopefully the paths you need to make
or change will be obvious.


copy server/usr-local-lib-php/* to /usr/local/lib/php
these are just Amazon's webservices, you can put them somewhere else, if
so then change server/getcoverart.php


mkdir /home/storage, and of course it should be writable by the user who 
will be running the server it should be readable by the user that runs 
the client (so the client can read the coverart files)


mkdir /home/storage/db 
this is where the SQLite database is stored, needs to be writable by the 
server user


Download the database schema and create the database in SQLite.
Look in the database/ directory available in the server tar file for an 
empty SQLite database and the schema.  You can use the empty SQLite 
database right away, just copy it to /home/storage/db/data.db


start up the server
    cd ./server ; ./server.pl --stderr
if you don't specify --stderr, it will write to syslog using /usr/bin/logger
(I plan on changing this to use a perl module).  It's mainly debugging and
progress information that is written out.  I'm also going to add automatic
daemonization


start up the client
    cd ./client ; ./interface.pl
This dumps a bunch of debugging information to stderr, mostly useless for
day to day operation


My production system starts up the server and the client from inittab, 
with the client in a dedicated X session.  Setting it up a machine as a 
dedicated jukebox is beyond the scope of this document, but anyone with 
reasonable UNIX knowledge should be able to muddle through it.  I can
give you the scripts I'm using and details on how I have my system
setup if need be.  More documentation on this will be forth coming,
if anyone asks.


The server/ripdisc.pl script uses cdparanoia and oggenc, you'll need to
have those installed, along with CDDB_get (available on CPAN).


That should be it.  You'll have to rip some CDs using the in-system CD 
ripper before you can start playing anything (in the works is import
functionality).  Admittedly, I have not tested it yet with a completely 
empty database -- I have no idea what the client will do.  Please let 
me know if you have any problems.
