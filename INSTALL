Just a short overview of the installation to get you started.  I am, of 
course, available to help you with installation.  You can contact me at
    ta at thwartedefforts dot org
or on ICQ at 240033388.

Check the file INSTALL_LIBS_AND_MODULES for dependancies.  More dependancies 
are listed on the website.  http://thwartedefforts.org/jukebox/

You might want to install dagrab for ripping CDs.  I've had extremely good 
experiences with it.  We'll fall back on cdda2wav and cdparanoia if you 
don't have it.  You can get dagrab from:

***************************** IMPORTANT *********************************
First thing you want to do is run the checkdeps script.  It will tell you
if you are missing something.  It will generate a file named 
thundaural-server.conf, which you should move either into the server 
directory or rename to /etc/thundaural/server.conf.
Some of the stuff you need to do is covered below, so be sure to read
this entire file.
***************************** IMPORTANT *********************************

After running checkdeps, review the thundaural-server.conf file.  You
especially want to make sure that the paths to the device files are correct,
and that the device files are accessible by the UNIX user who will be running
the server.


copy server/usr-local-lib-php/* to /usr/local/lib/php
these are just Amazon's webservices, you can put them somewhere else, if
so then change server/getcoverart.php


mkdir /home/storage, and of course it should be readable, writable and
accessible by the user who will be running the server.


mkdir /home/storage/db 
this is where the SQLite database is stored, needs the same access
permissions as /home/storage


In version 1.4, the server was modified to create the necessary database
structure if the datafile is empty.  All that is required is that the
/home/storage/db directory be created and be acccessible.
Later versions can some serious database changes, but the server is designed
to upgrade the database schema to the latest version automaticly, without
losing any data.

The taripdisc script uses cdda2wav and oggenc, you'll need to
have those installed, along with XML::Ximple (for the MusicBrainz
module) CDDB_get (for the FreeDB module). Both are available on CPAN).
I recommend you also install dagrab, which seems to work better than
cdda2wav.


You can use the checkdeps script to see if everything is installed.  
Please let me know if I missed anything.  If checkdeps doesn't report
positive results for everything, then you most likely don't have
something installed and will run into problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

start up the server
    cd ./server ; ./server.pl

start up the client
    cd ./client ; ./interface.pl

Both the client and server take can take --stderr or --syslog to have 
the debugging information go to stderr or syslog.  --syslog is the
default.

See the file startup/README.startup for information on starting the 
client and server automaticly on boot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

That should be it.  You'll have to rip some CDs using the in-system CD 
ripper before you can start playing anything (in the works is import
functionality).
