Just a short overview of the installation to get you started.  I am, of 
course, available to help you with installation.  You can contact me at
    ta at thwartedefforts dot org
or on ICQ at 240033388.

More dependancies are listed on the website.

Be sure you install ogg123 patched to include the --remote option.  Once
you patch it for that, be sure to patch it with my patch to fix a problem
with the --remote option.  More information is available on the 
Thundaural download page.


Review server/Settings.pm.  Hopefully the paths you need to make
or change will be obvious.


copy server/usr-local-lib-php/* to /usr/local/lib/php
these are just Amazon's webservices, you can put them somewhere else, if
so then change server/getcoverart.php


mkdir /home/storage, and of course it should be writable by the user who 
will be running the server it should be readable by the user that runs 
the client (so the client can read the coverart files)


mkdir /home/storage/db 
this is where the SQLite database is stored, needs to be writable by the 
server user


In version 1.4, the server was modified to create the necessary database
structure if the datafile is empty.  All that is required is that the
/home/storage/db directory be created and be acccessible.


You can use the checkdeps script to see if everything is installed.  
Please let me know if I missed anything.  If checkdeps doesn't report
positive results for everything, then you most likely don't have
something installed and will run into problems.


start up the server
    cd ./server ; ./server.pl

start up the client
    cd ./client ; ./interface.pl

Both the client and server take can take --stderr or --syslog to have 
the debugging information go to stderr or syslog.  --syslog is the
default.


My production system starts up the server and the client from inittab, 
with the client in a dedicated X session.  Setting it up a machine as a 
dedicated jukebox is beyond the scope of this document, but anyone with 
reasonable UNIX knowledge should be able to muddle through it.  I can
give you the scripts I'm using and details on how I have my system
setup if need be.  More documentation on this will be forth coming,
if anyone asks.


The server/ripdisc.pl script uses cdparanoia and oggenc, you'll need to
have those installed, along with CDDB_get (available on CPAN).


That should be it.  You'll have to rip some CDs using the in-system CD 
ripper before you can start playing anything (in the works is import
functionality).  Admittedly, I have not tested it yet with a completely 
empty database -- I have no idea what the client will do.  Please let 
me know if you have any problems.
