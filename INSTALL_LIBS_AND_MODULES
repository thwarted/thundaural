$Header: /home/cvs/thundaural/INSTALL_LIBS_AND_MODULES,v 1.2 2004/06/10 06:00:15 jukebox Exp $

Here's a quick list of of the libraries and perl modules needed by
Thundaural Jukebox.  Many desktop/workstation installations may
already have them.  Be sure to install any "development" packages
so you can compile the perl modules that link with those libraries.
I'm reasonablly sure this is an exhaustive list, but I might have
missed something.

Before you start installing things on this list, be sure to run the
checkdeps script, which will tell you if you need to install something.

Perl Modules
 - I think these are part of the perl standard distribution
   File::Basename
   Socket
   IO::Socket
   IO::Socket::INET
   IO::Select
   Data::Dumper
   IO::File

 - these are available on CPAN
   DBI
   DBD::SQLite
   LWP
   LWP::UserAgent
   XML::Ximple
   CDDB_get
   Ogg::Vorbis::Decoder
   Audio::Mad
   MP3::Info
   Audio::DSP
   Audio::Wav

 - these are all installed from perl-SDL. Download it from the
   thundaural downloads page
   SDL::Surface
   SDL::Constants
   SDL::App
   SDL::Event
   SDL::Color
   SDL::Timer
   SDL::Font
   SDL::TTFont
   SDL::Tool::Graphic
   SDL::Cursor

You'll also need a threaded perl (which you can verify with
"perl -V | grep 'usethreads=define'"), which should come with 
these modules:
   threads
   threads::shared
   Thread::Queue

You should install dagrab, which is a good, minimal, cdaudio
extractor, from http://vertigo.fme.vutbr.cz/~stibor/dagrab.html
