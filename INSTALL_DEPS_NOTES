This file describes various issues related to installation of
dependancy libraries that I ran into.  Your milage may vary.


SDL_gfx ---------------------------------------------------------------
When compiling SDL_gfx, you may encounter an error from the assembler
about redefined symbols.  Apparently, this is related to the use
of -O3, which inlines functions.  If you are compiling from a SRC RPM,
edit your RPM rc file (mine was /usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc) and change
the necessary "-O3" to "-O2 -frename-registers" and that should fix it.
Otherwise, set the CFLAGS env var on the command line before running
configure.  I've most recently experienced this problem with gcc 3.3.3, 
GNU assembler 2.14 20030612, and GNU ld version 2.14 20030612.
This problem exists in at least SDL_gfx 2.0.10, I also experienced it
in 2.0.11.   There is another problem with 2.0.11 when building the demos
(it's looking for header files in a subdir named SDL but that doesn't
exist.  Thundaural doesn't need the SDL_gfx demos, so you can just comment
out the "%package demos", "%files demos" and the stuff that happens in the
"Test" subdir during the %build.


SDL_perl --------------------------------------------------------------
The latest versions of SDL_perl use this new Build.PL build system, 
rather than the older Makefile.PL method.  Unfortunately, there is 
path detection problem that might crop up due to either lazily following
the FSSTD or strictly following it (I'm not sure which).  The fix is
to edit _build/notes and in the extra_compiler_flags array of the
OpenGL.xs section, add
	'-I/usr/X11R6/include'
right after
	'-I/usr/X11R6/include/GL'
Don't forget to install SDL_perl after installing all the other SDL 
sub-libraries.


libao -----------------------------------------------------------------
The libao SRC RPM from xiph.org (at least for version 0.8.4) requires
libarts and esound.  You can just comment out those requires lines.
The configure step detects that those libraries are missing and will
exclude support.  Thundaural only needs oggenc from vorbis-tools,
so the exact output audio methods doesn't really matter.


vorbis-tools ----------------------------------------------------------
The vorbis-tools SRC RPM from xiph.org requires FLAC and SPEEX, but 
thundaural jukebox doesn't need to decode those formats.  To disable
them, just comment them out of the .spec file.  The configure step
will automaticly pick-up that the libs are missing and not include 
support for them.


Audio::DSP ------------------------------------------------------------
Make sure your OSS-compatible audio drivers are loaded (or will be auto
loaded) before attempting to run the tests for Audio::DSP.  There also
seems to be a bug with the tests that keeps it from setting the audio
device properties during testing, but the module works fine anyway.
If you're using CPAN to install Audio::DSP, you might need to do
   force install Audio::DSP
if it fails the first time.


Audio::Wav ------------------------------------------------------------
For some reason, the tests fail to write the same audio file it reads.
This is unimportant for Thundaural, since we are only using Audio::Wav
to read files (and temporarily at that, until the server has a chance
to vorbis encode them).  If you're using CPAN, install with:
   force install Audio::Wav
if it fails the first time.
