changes from version 1.7 to 2.0

- new directory structure, moving all the programs out of client/ and server/
  and into the package root.  the scripts were also renamed to start with the
  prefix "ta" (for _T_hund_A_ural).  All perl modules are moved into the lib/
  directory.

- client has been completely rewritten to be more modular

- new client code supports different themes.  The interface is still closely 
  tied to the (theme's) code, so it's not trivial to create a new theme, but 
  different themes can be created without interfering with the base, original
  theme

- server detects inaccessiblity of the various devices it interacts with and
  will refuse to start up if it they are not accessible, rather than going into
  a state where it looks like it's working but doesn't

- fixed default -w option to aumix in the conf file checkdeps generates

- code should be self-contained now -- that is, no longer need to copy things
  to elsewhere in the filesystem to get it to work


changes from version 1.6 to version 1.7

- either rerun checkdeps and generate a new .conf file or edit your 
  conf file and change the line:

     cmd ripcdrom:ripdisc.pl --dbfile ${DBFILE} --device ${DEVICEFILE} --storagedir ${STORAGEDIR} ${PROGOPTS}
  to

     cmd ripcdrom:ripdisc.pl --dbfile ${DBFILE} --cddevice ${DEVICEFILE} --storagedir ${STORAGEDIR} ${PROGOPTS}

  note that the --device argument changed to --cddevice.  This is because
  the ripdisc script now uses the same command line parsing code that
  the server script uses.

- 'devices' command was including private entries (those that had a type
  that began with an underscore)

- fixed up database creation/upgrade code to work with SQLite3
  don't create functions while in a transaction
  ->prepare now fails on critical errors that used to happen in ->execute
  
- will now rip to WAV, which is faster, and encode to ogg in the background
  if there is at least 700 meg of free space on the filesystem that contains
  the storage dir.

- album-images.pl is included in the server directory

- See the file server/ADDING_PERSONAL_ARCHIVE.txt for information on using
  the personal-archive-load.pl script and the new features of ripdisc.pl to
  populate the thundaural database with tracks you obtained without having
  physical media, such as purchasing online.  Includes a preconfigured
  mode for loading tracks purchased from popular on-line music retailers,
  with more to come in the future.



changes from version 1.5.1 to version 1.6

- added copyright notices to files, included GPL in the file COPYING

- server code has been better organized into perl modules

- the server now supports a 'flush <devicename>' command, to remove all queued
  songs from that device
 
- automaticly upgrade the database to version 5.  the only change to the
  database is to expand the size of tracks.filename.  Then we search for file
  names that were short and try to find matching entries on the filename and
  update the database to be correct

- added new option, --convert, which invokes code to perform optional or
  risky updates manually.

- bah, I stupidly wasn't storing the tracknumber in either the filenames
  or the vorbis comments.  ripdisc.pl now does that, and a new optional
  converter can be run (tracknumtags) to rename all the song files and
  add the tracknumber tag to them.  See the --convert-help option to the
  server.pl script for more info.  Additional tags are also added, like
  RIPPER, CDINDEXID and CDDBID, for the sake of completeness.
  Performing the tracknumtags conversion is entirely optional.

- the format of the track filenames has changed to use double colons (::) to
  divide the components, rather than using a dash.  double colon seems to have
  fewer conflicts with actual track content.

- created an abstracted audio file reader to unify the interfaces between
  Audio::Mad and Ogg::Vorbis::Decoder.  New audio formats can be added in
  the future using this interface.  The server will now play MP3s (although
  this is currently of limited use because Thundaural does not support
  MP3s in any other way -- you can put MP3s in the system by editing the
  database manually).

- now uses Audio::DSP to play audio data.  No longer requires the patched
  ogg123 (using ogg123 was a nightmare)

- because of the last two changes above, the server now has much greater
  control of audio playback.  This allowed me to add a customized pause
  between songs, which is four seconds by default.  If two songs are from 
  sequential tracks on the same album, they will play with no pause between 
  them.  This will allow seamless full-album playing.

- changed to use Getopt::Long to parse server command line args

- now all options can be specified in a configuration file rather
  than perl code -- /etc/thundaural/server.conf replaces TAProgramLocations.pm
  and Settings.pm.  Multiple configuration files can be used, and they
  can be nested.

- removed --syslog and --stderr options, replaced with --log, which can
  take either 'syslog', 'stderr', or a filename to log to

- added --dumpconf option, which displays the configuration to stdout and exits

- fixed problem with LookupMusicBrainzRemote that was causing the performer
  field for the entire album to be set to which ever artist was listed
  last in the XML




changes from version 1.5 to version 1.5.1

- disabled the edit command, which has not been updated for the
  database schema changes.
  I missed checking this change in for the 1.5 release.


changes from version 1.4 to version 1.5

- completely new ripdisc.pl script that supports modular album
  lookup methods.  First it will try MusicBrainz, and failing that
  it will try FreeDB.  Additional modules can be added easily.
  Now requires XML::Ximple perl module (for MusicBrainz).  The
  new ripper does not support different agressiveness levels,
  which were required when using cdparanoia.
  cdda2wav is required for cdindexid and cddbid calculation.

- checkdeps script generates a TAProgramLocations.pm perl module
  that is used by the server.  After running checkdeps, be sure
  to move this file into the server directory.

- perfers dagrab over cdda2wav over cdparanoia for audio extraction
  Get dagrab from http://vertigo.fme.vutbr.cz/~stibor/dagrab.html
  Since we require cdda2wav elsewhere, we'll never actually try to
  use cdparaonia -- I know this, and maybe I'll get around to fixing
  it.  Or maybe not, I'm not too happy with the output of cdparanoia

- don't try to backup an empty database

- don't make it look like we support playing MP3s when we don't.
  had references to it in code that did execute, but I never
  tested it.

- added checksum command to server (clients should be better able
  to manage/reduce bandwidth with intelligent use)

- "coverart ripping" returns the cover art image for the current 
  ripping process

- client now takes --host and --port options to designate the
  server to connect to

- database gets upgraded to version 3:
    albums.source to store source of album information
    albums.cdindexid column to store musicbrainz CDindex
    albums can have more than one image
    performers abstracted to another table
    support for individual track attributes (for future expansion)

- rank numbering fixed.  If the top two tracks have the same
  popularity, they'll both be ranked first.  The next possible
  ranking is third (because there are two tracks before it), and there
  is no track ranked second

- new server command 'version', which reports the client/server
  protocol version number (currently at 4)

- client verifies it's talking to a compatible server before continuing

- removed printing of the genres in the client, since protocol v4
  doesn't support them (they were moved to the trackattributes table)

- verified that ripping speed is correct (vorbis encoding seems to be
  the limiter (can't get faster than ~5x on my test machine, but dagrab
  will rip to a file at around 12x.  Rip to a file and then encode to
  vorbis takes roughly the same amount of time as doing it in a 
  pipeline))

- trying out a new background image from the excellent legacy Propaganda 
  collection (ich bin ein good looking desktop whore) to hold me over
  until the interface gets ravamped.  To revert the old brushed-metal-like 
  one, change the lines that are commented out in the load_images function 
  in client/interface.pl

- included startup script for the server in the startup/ directory, and for 
  the client in the client/ directory.  See startup/README.startup 
  or the installation page on the website for instructions on use.

- added --dontfork option to the server, which keeps it from daemonizing
  itself (which it does by default now)

- fixed bug that was keeping the albums page from being updated if there
  were less than 6 albums in the database and new album was ripped

- other cleanups of both minor and major natures



changes from version 1.3 to version 1.4

- renamed Statistics.pm to Periodic.pm, since it will now handle
  things we want to do periodicly

- removed bogus dependency on DBI in the client

- checkdeps script now checks for other SDL libraries needed for
  SDL_perl

- server supports random play using the randomize command

- beginnings for the client interface for randomized play
  (showing the current status is kind of buggy)

- minor visual changes to the popularity display in the track listing

- server returns response code 202 when a block of binary data is
  being sent

- 'coverart <albumid>' command added to server, which dumps the
  cover art file to the client.

- client doesn't know about local storage of cover art files anymore
  it uses the new coverart command to download them from the server
  and locally caches them in /tmp

- server now builds the database if it doesn't exist, no need to
  manually create it using the SQLite command line client (which
  might not exist if you installed DBI::SQLite)

- server can now automaticly upgrade the database if the database
  format changes

- removed dependency on the Microsoft Webfonts Arial and Georgia.
  the freely available Bitstream Vera fonts look better
  (and can be freely redistributed)



changes from version 1.2 to version 1.3

- bah, tell Data::Dumper to dump hashes sorted, so comparsions
  work and we only update when we need to

- Ripping page has been updated to be more user friendly
  and use less CPU when updating

- Ripping page shows the ripping speed as a function of the length
  of the track, as reported by server/ripdisc.pl

- Added Stats page

- Removed a lot of debugging messages

- Converted to use Sys::Syslog rather than /usr/bin/logger

- added a simple script checkdeps which verifies that you have
  everything you need installed

- fixed track listing drawing overflow when different font is used
  on the tracks page

- if the server only reports one output, don't give the option
  to select output on the tracks page

- some minor layout changes to the tracks page

- restricted font use to two fonts, both of which are in the msfonts
  rpm on the website



changes from version 1.1 to version 1.2

- tested the whole thing with the provided empty database to
  ensure that you can bootstrap the system to usability by
  ripping discs.  I had originally imported the data from my
  pre-1.0 MySQL database, so I never worked on this codebase
  with an empty database.  Some of the fixes below are due to
  this testing.

- client now actually recovers gracefully from errors from the
  server, the abstraction code returns empty values rather than
  the error codes.

- client now handles no albums in the database correctly by
  showing a message to that effect.

- client handles less than 6 albums in the database correctly,
  previously, it would display some blank album covers oddly.

- additional server thread dedicated to updating track rankings 
  (will be used in the future to update other statistics also).
  Also, removed the undocumented 'rankupdate' command that
  manually invoked the update function.

- more verification that player and reader thread re-spawning
  works when they die (new undocumented server command 'exit
  <devicename>' to test this).

- main server threads yields after notifying worker threads to
  exit to avoid threads-still-running-on-exit race condition



changes from version 1.0 to version 1.1

- database change: new colum tracks.riperrors which ripdisc.pl will 
  record how many corrections cdparanoia claims it had to make.  In 
  the future this will be used to help determine if any tracks need 
  to be re-ripped or replaced.  cdparanoia is excellent at error 
  correction, but sometimes leaves pops and skip noises in the audio.
  You'll need to modify the tracks table by hand to add this colum:
  in SQLite (which doesn't have alter or rename statements):
      create table oldtracks as select * from tracks;
      .schema tracks
      drop tracks;
      CREATE TABLE tracks (
        trackid integer,
        albumid int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
        performer varchar(128) NOT NULL default '',
        length int(11) default NULL,
        name varchar(128) NOT NULL default '',
        albumorder int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
        genreid int(11) default NULL,
        popularity float default NULL,
        rank int(11) default NULL,
        filename varchar(128) NOT NULL default '',
        riperrors varchar(24) default NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY  (trackid)
      );
      insert into tracks select *, NULL from oldtracks;
      drop table oldtracks;

- added a --aggressive option to ripdisc.pl, which takes an argument
  from 0 to 9.  The higher the aggressiveness, the greater tolerance
  of error corrections per sector it will be.  Based on the agressive
  value, it will eventually give up the error correction and just
  tell cdparanoia to rip it without any error correction.  The default
  is maximum agressiveness (9).
  The server doesn't support taking an agressiveness argument from the
  client and the client doesn't offer the user an option for 
  aggressiveness (yet).

- more status information is generated for ripping

- the client and server now support aborting a rip in progress.

- a bunch of strange bugs were fixed in the client, mostly related to 
  odd crashes when using SDL::Timer and how it interacts with perl.  I've 
  gotten rid of using SDL::Timer objects all together.  The client is
  a lot stabler now.

- I removed some of the larger, unused files from the client/images
  directory that were left over from my testing.

- Fixed some bugs with the slider on the albums page, it was being positioned
  all the way to the left when it should have been all the way to the right

- Client now uses Data::Dumper to determine if the screen needs to be updated
  This cuts down on memory usage, as there appears to be a bug in the TTF
  libs I'm using, or SDL::TTFont code such that memory gets leaked everytime 
  lots of text is drawn to a surface.
